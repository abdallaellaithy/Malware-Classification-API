## Overview

The Malware Classification API is a machine learning-based system for predicting malware types using a trained classification model. It provides a simple endpoint for making predictions based on the features of malware samples.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

### Installation

1 - Clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/abdallaellaithy/Malware-Classification-API.git`

2 - Navigate to the project directory:

`cd malware-classification-api`

### Running the API

1. Build the Docker image:
`docker build -t malware-classification-api .`
  
2. Run the Docker container:
`docker run -p 8000:8000 malware-classification-api`



The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/predict`.

### Using the API

You can use the provided API to classify malware samples by sending POST requests with the sample features.

Example Python Usage:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
sample_data = df.head(5)

sample_features = sample_data.drop(columns=['Unnamed: 0', '0', 'Label'])
sample_features.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Define the URL of the API endpoint
url = 'http://localhost:8000/predict'

# Convert the sample features to a list of lists
sample_features_list = sample_features.values.tolist()

# Send a POST request to the API endpoint
response = requests.post(url, json={'features': sample_features_list})

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
 # Get the prediction from the response
 prediction = response.json()['prediction']
 print("Predicted labels:", prediction)
else:
 print("Error:", response.text)
```
# Model Details
The API employs a machine learning model trained on a dataset of malware samples. The model uses a Random Forest Classifier algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. The features used by the model are selected using the Chi-squared statistic through the SelectKBest method from scikit-learn.
